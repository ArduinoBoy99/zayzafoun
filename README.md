### TODO:

* Create Admin control panel.
* Create Email subscription widget in the footer.
* Add "ShareThis" widget to posts.
* Some code needs to be cleaned.

To be honest this is not the normal coding style I do, but if I see a group of people interested in this script, maybe I continue working on improving it.
